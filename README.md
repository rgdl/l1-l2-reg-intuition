# Use simulations to gain intuition on the effect of L1 vs L2 regularisation

Use a streamlit app in a docker container to create interactive plotly graphs. Create a well-documented github repo, with instructions to run in docker or not.

This README should just be for the repo, build instructions, etc. Write the Medium post in ABOUT.md

You'll need `docker` to run this code.

## To Run:
```
make build
```
Then navigate to localhost:8501 in a web browser.

## To Test:
```
make test
```
